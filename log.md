* Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp Day 3 + 4: HTML.
* Playing around with creating containers and templates for [hirokonishimura.com](https://github.com/hironyc/hirokonishimura.com).
* Brainstorming layouts; added in the Bootstrap files.

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**

* [Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp](https://learn.skillcrush.com/classes/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp-wpcw/)

**Thoughts:** Delving a little deeper into the concept of "UI/UX/Front End Developer." Still a lot of thinking required before I can solidify what exactly I want to strive for and do. Exhausted from the chemo and socializing over the weekend, so couldn't get much coding in.  Still going through the Bootstrap beginner crash course on YouTube.  Found the DevFreeBooks resource, so may start reading some of them on tablet for HTML and Javascript.

### Day 7: 9/16/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* Reading Bootstrap documentation from [GetBootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to comprehend the concept better.
* Enrolled in to [Skillcrush 10-Day Bootcamp](https://learn.skillcrush.com/classes/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp-wpcw/); Completed Day 1 and 2.
* Creating template for first project: Redoing [hirokonishimura.com](http://hirokonishimura.com) (Portfolio).
* Starting the template with Bootstrap template to see the process of designing/coding website using Bootstrap.
* Learning a little more about how to create new repositories on Github Desktop.

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**
* [Bootstrap Beginner Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GcQtLDGXy8)
* [Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp](https://learn.skillcrush.com/classes/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp-wpcw/)

**Thoughts:** Took a break from the Wordpress Theme course for the day and looked for other sources about Bootstrap.  Also started a 10 day "bootcamp" on the fundamentals of starting a career in tech.  Started brainstorming about portfolio layout/content, and started a new repository for it.

### Day 6: 9/14/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 20-21; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hironyc/wp-theme-01)
* Learned about CSS Sprites and how to use/code for them in CSS
* Reading up on Grid System in Bootstrap

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:**  More new concepts like Sprites learned.  Finally looking into what the numbers next to col-sm-6, etc. are by reading up on how the grid system works in Bootstrap. 12 is the magic number!  Not sure what the difference is between "Strikethrough Text" and "Deleted Text" but I'm sure there's some semantic difference between the two (same with "Inserted Text" an "Underlined Text").
Project idea: Want to look into doing a "rotating quote" page/website for the AVM survey responses to encourage survivors and caregivers.

### Day 5: 9/13/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 17-19; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hironyc/wp-theme-01)
* Watched video on the basics of Wordpress Themes [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTRZYnYQlmo)
* Learned about [Modals](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp).  Obviously wouldn't work properly.

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:**  More CSS review; I would have been inclined to "cheat" by adding stylesheet elements directly into the file, but I guess it's much better practice to add it in to the css file.  Spent some time setting up Project Management boards for projects to take on after learning how to create Wordpress Themes.  Will probably start with [Burgundy for Life](http://burgundyforlife.org) because the layout I'm thinking about most closely resembles what we are creating in the course.  Watched a video on the "basics" (the REAL basics) of how to create Wordpress Themes, and now I feel like I am a step closer to putting it all together at the end.  The Modal prompt loads but then immediately goes away, which is strange. It doesn't seem to be a "browser issue" either, as it happens in both Chrome and Firefox.  Another mystery for another day of problem solving.  I just realized that even though I commit both repositories, Github only counts it as 1 commit a day. Rude!

### Day 4: 9/12/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 15-16; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hironyc/wp-theme-01)
* Learned about the [Parallax Effect](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-parallax-scrolling-technique--net-27641).
* Learning more about Bootstrap

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:**  Learning about new effects on front end that I wasn't aware of before, troubleshooting minor bugs, and wondering why things just don't work properly. It's nice to get back to "reading" code again, and understand what is doing what, and why certain things are inputted a certain way.  Hope with a few more weeks, I'll be back to "reading" CSS and HTML and "writing" them I used to back in high school.  
Finally dabbled in Javascript.  It'll be whiles yet until I'll be comfortable even trying to decipher what's going on there, but glad it's not as foreign looking as I had feared.

### Day 3: 9/11/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 13-14; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hironyc/wp-theme-01)
* Issue from yesterday: resolved by adding bootstrap.min.js script. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* Refreshers on CSS and Bootstrap integration into CSS.

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:**  For some reason, custom.css wasn't getting pulled in to the wp-theme-01, and caused a lot of issues.  And then just as strangely, the issue just went away.  So not too sure what happened there.  There are still kinkls, but I think I need to look at it over again tomorrow with a fresh set of eyes.

### Day 2: 9/10/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 10-12; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hironyc/wp-theme-01)
* Re-learn how to use Google Fonts.
* Bootstrap Navigation.
* Installed FileZilla to this computer.
* Tried to figure out why my collapsed navigation won't expand, but couldn't. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_navbar.asp)

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:** A little disappointed I couldn't figure out why the navigation in its collapsed form won't expand in the B2W theme I'm creating, despite going through and confirming everything matches (even the documentation on w3).  Hopefully in the coming days I'll see something or the instructor will go over some small period we missed that makes his copy and my copy different!  Otherwise, "Font Awesome" was a pretty cool find.  Hope to use it soon for my blog.

### Day 1: 9/9/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* Set up Github account and play around with web interface.
* Set up [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/hironyc/100-days-of-code) Repo.
* Install GitHub Desktop and learn to Commit/Upload.
* Customize Atom UI.
* B2W: Lectures 7-9; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hironyc/wp-theme-01)
* Fiddle around with Wordpress theme and pages/text on Blog

**Language(s):** HTML5, jQuery

**Course(s):** Wordpress Theme Development with Bootstrap (udemy) -> B2W

**Thoughts:** First day of #100DaysOfCode! Figured out how to use GitHub, which I was meaning to do for weeks, and set up Atom Editor UI preferences. Started the actual coding process on B2W. I began the challenge on a whim, but I'm glad I was able to get most things set up so that it is easier to continue for the days/weeks/months to come.
