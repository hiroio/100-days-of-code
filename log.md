### Day 23: 10/2/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Small edits on sections/code.  
* Going to work on making code for both websites accessible, maybe starting with Burgundy for Life, since the website is smaller.
* Need to think about how to do the quote rotation website.  (Project Love?)


**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**

**Thoughts:**  Kind of wiped out from yesterday's push of creating a whole website in one setting.  Took a break today for the most part.  Looking to "clean up" code I've been writing and removing things that don't need to be there/clutter the code, since they make code do unexpected things.

### Day 22: 10/1/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Trying to figure out Javascript for "quote rotation" script provided by a Twitter follower.
* Created new website from scratch for [Burgundy for Life](http://burgundyforlife.org).

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**

**Thoughts:**  Had the idea and then knocked it out: made a new website for [burgundy for life](http://burgundyforlife.org) just in time for AVM awareness month that started today.  Learned a lot of new things as always, and was able to put a background image into a DIV and make it have a different opacity.

**Course(s):**
* Front End Web Development Certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* Learn CSS on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

**Thoughts:**  Not much coding or learning today except some FreeCodeCamp pages, because JAMF CCT certification exam tomorrow afternoon.  Edited the portfolio a little bit for text and layout orientation.  Need to get back into the WPTHEME course so I can learn how to make Bootstrap into Wordpress.  Still contemplating whether I want to keep the portfolio pure HTML/CSS or embed Bootstrap to it.

### Day 17: 9/26/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Made the "about me" section a [Media Object](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/media-object/).
* Created a footer.  Now if only it'd stick to the bottom of the page!
* Claimed [hiroko.github.io](http://hiroko.github.io).

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**
* Front End Web Development Certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* Learn CSS on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

**Thoughts:**  General tinkering of the portfolio and styling.  Trying to find issues and troubleshoot them.  Next up os trying to figure out how to "stick" the footer to the bottom. Need to also figure out how to have the small columns for the "skills" so they don't "bleed out" in smaller frames (like the macbook air I am using at training).

### Day 16: 9/25/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Learn CSS course on Code Academy.
* Added writing.html and its child pages to portfolio.
* [PDF embed with HTML](https://pdfobject.com/static.html). (Maybe Javascript in the future?)
* Cleaning up code (removing justify-content-center from columns).

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**
* Front End Web Development Certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* Learn CSS on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

**Thoughts:**  Glad there was not much styling necessary to make the portfolio navigation image act as a link (just a border="0").  The PDF embed via <object> is a little messy, but at least it works fine (doesn't look the best).  Not sure if there's really any way to make it look any better, and having a download link works.  On mobile, it doesn't work, but it has the fall-back "click here to download" link, so it should be fine.  Not sure what other works I will put on there, but I guess I'll go and collect stuff I've written to put on there.
Not sure if individual .html pages is the best way to go (especially because I can't get metrics), but it'll have to do until I figure out a better solution.  PHP seems a little over the top, especially because the navigations I want won't be the same.

### Day 15: 9/24/2017

**Today's Progress**
* CodeAcademy: Learn HTML completed.
* "Technical Experiences" style-sheeted up.
* Starting formatting of the "Work Experiences" section.
* Finally fiddled with the margins up top of the page.

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**
* Front End Web Development Certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
* Learn CSS on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

**Thoughts:**  Completed the "Learn HTML" course in CodeAcademy.  Next up is the CSS course.  Working on stylistic issues.  The DIVs at the "Technical Experiences" section giving me issues with different browser sizes.  Just can't get it to look good in all.

### Day 14: 9/23/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Removed Scrollspy code from index.html: fixed the margin issue (container-fluid wasn't making the width 100%).
* Moved content around on the page.
* Added "About Me" and "Resources" sections and removed the "Lorem Ipsum" content box.
* Troubleshooting the container-fluid not being 100% width issue (was one of the scrollspy divs).
* Troubleshooting the gallery-centering issue (the row didn't have justify-content-center tag).

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**
* Front End Web Development Certification on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

**Thoughts:**  Yesterday was the "I want to do this, let's figure out how" day, and today was the "Why doesn't this look exactly the way I want?" day.  Spent most of the time tweaking code and moving things around to make them look nicer. Mostly spent time troubleshooting. Joined #Javascript30.  Might start looking into it tomorrow or next week.  Began the Front End Web Development course on freeCodeCamp.  Going to look into the HTML and CSS courses on Code Academy as well.

### Day 13: 9/22/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Fixed the navbar anchor overshooting problem by using .span tag in the headers, and tweaking the css so that the stylesheet does not break down because of the edit. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10732690/offsetting-an-html-anchor-to-adjust-for-fixed-header)
* Rounded corners on images!!
* [CCS-Tricks: Text Blocks Over Image](https://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/)
* What does [Justify-Content](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/j/justify-content/) actually mean?

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**

**Thoughts:** I got a few things I was working on troubleshooting/creating to work, like the navigation overshooting the anchor tag, and making the image (to-be-links) in portfolio all fancy with CSS.  In the process, I broke the scrollspy, so there's that.  Found out it seems like it only works with DIVs and not SPANs, but the span is necessary in order to get the anchor links to work so... I guess it's more important I have the navigation working more than little shiny gimmicks... But it's stil sad because it was working fine.  Figured out how to make the rounded images effect, so used it for the "profile photo" and the portfolio images.

### Day 12: 9/21/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Google Fonts and how to use them.
* Trying to figure out Anchor Tags in HTML5.
* Learned and implemented [Scrollspy](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/scrollspy/) in Bootstrap for the main navigation.
* CSS tests.
* Extensive troubleshooting for ACTIVE being on the wrong link at page load. (Resolved)
* Extensive troubleshooting for Y-coordinate being off at Anchor.
* To Do: Make the NAVBAR into list.

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**

**Thoughts:** Spent way too long on the navigation troubleshooting... But learned and applied Scrollspy, and troubleshooted the incorrect highlighting issue at page load (CONTACT was being highlighted instead of ME).  Now need to resolve the fact that the Anchor link from the navigation overshoots the actual ID by 50PX.  Something to do with Y-value needing to be anchored... But not sure what that means or how to fix it. Maybe tomorrow. A lot of stylesheet tasks done today to style the overall layout.

### Day 11: 9/20/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp Day 9 + 10: Programming Languages, PHP. Completed Bootcamp.
* Stylesheet editing and learning.
* Using Bootstrap official documentation to learn and implement components.

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Course(s):**
* [Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp](https://learn.skillcrush.com/classes/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp-wpcw/) - Completed.

**Thoughts:**

**Link(s) to Work:** [hiroko.io](https://github.com/hiroko/hiroko.io)

**Links to Resources:** Completed the [Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp](https://learn.skillcrush.com/classes/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp-wpcw/).  As basic as the content was, it was informational in the most basic level (which I honestly needed), like the difference between Web Designer, UX Designer, UI Designer, and Graphic Designer.  HTML runs in your browser, and PHP runs in the server.

Worked on the portfolio layout.  Something that started out as just playing around with effects may turn into an actual layout. Slowly adding parts in while learning about them.  Because the B2W course's Bootstrap version is outdated, I have to research every effect I want to implement that I learned about in the course (which is honestly pretty good way to practice).


### Day 10: 9/19/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Purchased [hiroko.io](https://github.com/hiroko/hiroko.io) to replace hirokonishimura.com.
* Bootstrap Beginner Crash Course continued
* Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp Day 7 + 8: FrontEnd/BackEnd, Wordpress.
* Learned how to use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/) icons, and utilized in [hiroko.io](https://github.com/hiroko/hiroko.io) to practice.

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

**Thoughts:** Last night, I was able to score "hiroko" as my Github username.  Excited, I purchased hiroko.io this morning, to match.  Now I'm doubly excited and motivated to create a portfolio to test out and play with everything I am learning at the moment and everything I'm about to learn in the upcoming weeks.  It's double digits now! Still playing around with CSS and HTML, and slowly re-learning CSS3. Figured out how to use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/cheatsheet/) icons, and read up on a few documentations for it.  Playing around with Bootstrap columns and rows, and debugging the code.

### Day 9: 9/18/2017

**Today's Progress**
* Replaced  style="text-align: center;" CSS tag with class="text-center" Bootstrap class.
* Bootstrap Beginner Crash Course continued.
* SKillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp Day 5 + 6: CSS, Javascript, Visual Design, UX/UI.
* div class="clearfix" to "clear" DIV properties.

**Language(s):** Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

* [Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp](https://learn.skillcrush.com/classes/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp-wpcw/)

**Thoughts:** From the Visual Design/UX/UI section of the 10 Day Bootcamp, I figured out I am probably aiming to be a Web Designer or a UX Designer (since I can't really draw/icon).  UI designers and Graphic Designers make things pretty. I would love to get into Graphic Designing (as long as it doesn't require drawing) at some point though. I also remembered today that I still want to get into Portrait Photography. Maybe one of these days, I'll have enough free time to learn everything I want to learn.  Having fun moving things around in the very basic and bare template I'm creating (that's more for practice, and less for practical use) for the portfolio.  Looking for key words and phrases to accent my portfolio with, too.  Mindfulness in words! I think I want to make my designs benefit from Minimalism as well.

**Today's Progress:**
* Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp Day 3 + 4: HTML.

* [Skillcrush 10 Day Bootcamp](https://learn.skillcrush.com/classes/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp-wpcw/)

**Thoughts:** Delving a little deeper into the concept of "UI/UX/Front End Developer." Still a lot of thinking required before I can solidify what exactly I want to strive for and do. Exhausted from the chemo and socializing over the weekend, so couldn't get much coding in.  Still going through the Bootstrap beginner crash course on YouTube.  Found the DevFreeBooks resource, so may start reading some of them on tablet for HTML and Javascript.

I have so many "habits" and "daily to-do's," it would be cool to have one of my projects be a ticker kind of like the GitHub contribution chart, where there are bunches of boxes that gets colored in when I do a certain task and mark it as complete for the day.  Not sure where to even start with coding up something like that though.

### Day 7: 9/16/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* Reading Bootstrap documentation from [GetBootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to comprehend the concept better.
* Enrolled in to [Skillcrush 10-Day Bootcamp](https://learn.skillcrush.com/classes/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp-wpcw/); Completed Day 1 and 2.
* Creating template for first project: Redoing [hirokonishimura.com](https://github.com/hiroko/hiroko.io) (Portfolio).
* Starting the template with Bootstrap template to see the process of designing/coding website using Bootstrap.
* Learning a little more about how to create new repositories on Github Desktop.

**Thoughts:** Took a break from the Wordpress Theme course for the day and looked for other sources about Bootstrap.  Also started a 10 day "bootcamp" on the fundamentals of starting a career in tech.  Started brainstorming about portfolio layout/content, and started a new repository for it.

### Day 6: 9/14/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 20-21; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hiroko/wp-theme-01)
* Learned about CSS Sprites and how to use/code for them in CSS
* Reading up on Grid System in Bootstrap

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:**  More new concepts like Sprites learned.  Finally looking into what the numbers next to col-sm-6, etc. are by reading up on how the grid system works in Bootstrap. 12 is the magic number!  Not sure what the difference is between "Strikethrough Text" and "Deleted Text" but I'm sure there's some semantic difference between the two (same with "Inserted Text" an "Underlined Text").
Project idea: Want to look into doing a "rotating quote" page/website for the AVM survey responses to encourage survivors and caregivers.

### Day 5: 9/13/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 17-19; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hiroko/wp-theme-01)
* Watched video on the basics of Wordpress Themes [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTRZYnYQlmo)
* Learned about [Modals](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp).  Obviously wouldn't work properly.

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:**  More CSS review; I would have been inclined to "cheat" by adding stylesheet elements directly into the file, but I guess it's much better practice to add it in to the css file.  Spent some time setting up Project Management boards for projects to take on after learning how to create Wordpress Themes.  Will probably start with [Burgundy for Life](http://burgundyforlife.org) because the layout I'm thinking about most closely resembles what we are creating in the course.  Watched a video on the "basics" (the REAL basics) of how to create Wordpress Themes, and now I feel like I am a step closer to putting it all together at the end.  The Modal prompt loads but then immediately goes away, which is strange. It doesn't seem to be a "browser issue" either, as it happens in both Chrome and Firefox.  Another mystery for another day of problem solving.  I just realized that even though I commit both repositories, Github only counts it as 1 commit a day. Rude!

### Day 4: 9/12/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 15-16; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hiroko/wp-theme-01)
* Learned about the [Parallax Effect](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-simple-parallax-scrolling-technique--net-27641).
* Learning more about Bootstrap

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:**  Learning about new effects on front end that I wasn't aware of before, troubleshooting minor bugs, and wondering why things just don't work properly. It's nice to get back to "reading" code again, and understand what is doing what, and why certain things are inputted a certain way.  Hope with a few more weeks, I'll be back to "reading" CSS and HTML and "writing" them I used to back in high school.  
Finally dabbled in Javascript.  It'll be whiles yet until I'll be comfortable even trying to decipher what's going on there, but glad it's not as foreign looking as I had feared.

### Day 3: 9/11/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 13-14; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hiroko/wp-theme-01)
* Issue from yesterday: resolved by adding bootstrap.min.js script. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* Refreshers on CSS and Bootstrap integration into CSS.

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:**  For some reason, custom.css wasn't getting pulled in to the wp-theme-01, and caused a lot of issues.  And then just as strangely, the issue just went away.  So not too sure what happened there.  There are still kinkls, but I think I need to look at it over again tomorrow with a fresh set of eyes.

### Day 2: 9/10/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 10-12; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hiroko/wp-theme-01)
* Re-learn how to use Google Fonts.
* Bootstrap Navigation.
* Installed FileZilla to this computer.
* Tried to figure out why my collapsed navigation won't expand, but couldn't. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_navbar.asp)

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:** A little disappointed I couldn't figure out why the navigation in its collapsed form won't expand in the B2W theme I'm creating, despite going through and confirming everything matches (even the documentation on w3).  Hopefully in the coming days I'll see something or the instructor will go over some small period we missed that makes his copy and my copy different!  Otherwise, "Font Awesome" was a pretty cool find.  Hope to use it soon for my blog.

### Day 1: 9/9/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* Set up Github account and play around with web interface.
* Set up [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/hiroko/100-days-of-code) Repo.
* Install GitHub Desktop and learn to Commit/Upload.
* Customize Atom UI.
* B2W: Lectures 7-9; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hiroko/wp-theme-01)

**Language(s):** HTML5, jQuery

**Course(s):** Wordpress Theme Development with Bootstrap (udemy) -> B2W

**Thoughts:** First day of #100DaysOfCode! Figured out how to use GitHub, which I was meaning to do for weeks, and set up Atom Editor UI preferences. Started the actual coding process on B2W. I began the challenge on a whim, but I'm glad I was able to get most things set up so that it is easier to continue for the days/weeks/months to come.
