# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: 9/11/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 13-14; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hironyc/wp-theme-01)
* Issue from yesterday: resolved by adding bootstrap.min.js script. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* Refreshers on CSS and Bootstrap integration into CSS.

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:**  For some reason, custom.css wasn't getting pulled in to the wp-theme-01, and caused a lot of issues.  And then just as strangely, the issue just went away.  So not too sure what happened there.  There are still kinkls, but I think I need to look at it over again tomorrow with a fresh set of eyes.

### Day 2: 9/10/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* B2W: Lectures 10-12; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hironyc/wp-theme-01)
* Re-learn how to use Google Fonts.
* Bootstrap Navigation.
* Installed FileZilla to this computer.
* Tried to figure out why my collapsed navigation won't expand, but couldn't. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_navbar.asp)

**Language(s):** HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap

**Course(s):** B2W

**Thoughts:** A little disappointed I couldn't figure out why the navigation in its collapsed form won't expand in the B2W theme I'm creating, despite going through and confirming everything matches (even the documentation on w3).  Hopefully in the coming days I'll see something or the instructor will go over some small period we missed that makes his copy and my copy different!  Otherwise, "Font Awesome" was a pretty cool find.  Hope to use it soon for my blog.

### Day 1: 9/9/2017

**Today's Progress:**
* Set up Github account and play around with web interface.
* Set up [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/hironyc/100-days-of-code) Repo.
* Install GitHub Desktop and learn to Commit/Upload.
* Customize Atom UI.
* B2W: Lectures 7-9; [wp-theme-01](https://github.com/hironyc/wp-theme-01)
* Fiddle around with Wordpress theme and pages/text on Blog

**Language(s):** HTML5, jQuery

**Course(s):** Wordpress Theme Development with Bootstrap (udemy) -> B2W

**Thoughts:** First day of #100DaysOfCode! Figured out how to use GitHub, which I was meaning to do for weeks, and set up Atom Editor UI preferences. Started the actual coding process on B2W. I began the challenge on a whim, but I'm glad I was able to get most things set up so that it is easier to continue for the days/weeks/months to come.
