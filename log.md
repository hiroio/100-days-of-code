**Course(s):** Wordpress Theme Development with Bootstrap (udemy) -> B2W

**Thoughts:** First day of #100DaysOfCode! Figured out how to use GitHub, which I was meaning to do for weeks, and set up Atom Editor UI preferences. Started the actual coding process on B2W. I began the challenge on a whim, but I'm glad I was able to get most things set up so that it is easier to continue for the days/weeks/months to come.
